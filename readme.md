# DungeonDraft files for Lord Haywire's Large Crappy Maps

These files require the use of Forgotten Adventures DungeonDraft assets, both version 2 and 3.  You have to buy them from Forgotten Adventures (I have no affilation with them) and redirect where DungeonDraft looks for those assets.

Forgotten Adventures sells the assets through their [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/forgottenadventures).

This hasn't been tested and may be a clusterfuck.  If you want to test it out with me then hit me up while I am streaming on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lordhaywire).

## Maps

When I get around to it I will put the specific assets I used for each map here.

### Farm North South

Roofs went missing.  Will need to fix at some point

# DungeonDraft files for Lord Haywire's Large Crappy Maps FoundryVTT Module

These files require the use of Forgotten Adventures DungeonDraft assets, both version 2 and 3.  You have to buy them from Forgotten Adventures (I have no affilation with them) and make sure DungeonDraft knows you are using those assets for the specific maps.

Forgotten Adventures sells the assets through their [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/forgottenadventures).

If you are watching me stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lordhaywire) then you can download the files I started working on at the beginning of the stream from the [streaming](https://github.com/lordhaywire/dungeondraft-maps/tree/streaming) branch.

This hasn't been tested and may be a clusterfuck.  If you want to test it out with me then hit me up while I am streaming or join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/a6KzcJ9mnC).

These maps are used in my [FoundryVTT module repository](https://github.com/lordhaywire/lh-largecrappymaps) which can also be found in the [FoundryVTT module directory](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/lh-largecrappymaps).

## Maps

The maps are listed in order that I "finished" them.  They all have roofs and excluding Farm North South all of them have multiple levels.  I do the walls and lighting in FoundryVTT.

## Assets

The Forgotten Adventures asset versions are listed with the map.

I want to do a map that takes place inside a giant dead monster so if you know of any assets that include walls made of rotting flesh, pools of blood, and other such things then please contact me!

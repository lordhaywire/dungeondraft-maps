# DungeonDraft files for Lord Haywire's Large Crappy Maps

These files require the use of Forgotten Adventures DungeonDraft assets, both version 2 and 3.  You have to buy them and put them in a folder called Assets inside this directory or rearrange where DungeonDraft looks for those assets.

Forgotten Adventures sells the assets through their [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/forgottenadventures).

This hasn't been tested and may be a clusterfuck.  If you want to test it out with me then hit me up while I am streaming on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lordhaywire).

## Maps

When I get around to it I will put the specific assets I used for each map here.

# DungeonDraft files for Lord Haywire's Large Crappy Maps

These files require the use of Forgotten Adventures DungeonDraft assets, both version 2 and 3.  You have to buy them from Forgotten Adventures (I have no affilation with them) and make sure DungeonDraft knows you are using those assets for the specific maps.

Forgotten Adventures sells the assets through their [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/forgottenadventures).

If you are watching me stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lordhaywire) then you can download the files I started working on at the beginning of the stream from the [streaming](https://github.com/lordhaywire/dungeondraft-maps/tree/streaming) branch.

This hasn't been tested and may be a clusterfuck.  If you want to test it out with me then hit me up while I am streaming or join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/a6KzcJ9mnC).

## Maps

The maps are listed in order that I "finished" them.  They all have roofs and excluding Farm North South all of them have multiple levels.  I do the walls and lighting in FoundryVTT which means the wall data could be messed up with an import to FoundryVTT.  There should be no lighting data.

### Farm North South

Farm land with a road running from the north to the south.

#### Assets

I believe the version number doesn't matter as long as it is higher then the version listed below but not to the next full version.  For example, if the asset is FA_Assets_A_v3.04 then I believe FA_Assets_a_v3.04 through v3.99 should work.

### Work in Progress (WIP)

These maps can be found in the WIP folder.  They can be in any state of existance including missing completely.

#### City Center

Will be multiple levels.  Currently ground level is started.

Underground/Sewer level

Ground level

First floor

First floor roofs (this will be just for the roofs of the buildings that are only one story)

Second floor

Second floor roofs (this will be just for the roofs of the buildings that are only one story)

#### Murder Mystery

I have an idea for a murder mystery D&D adventure.  Currently the maps aren't started.  It will require some planning which I generally don't like to do.
